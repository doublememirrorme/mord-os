# Mord OS - one OS to rule them all

Mord OS is a simple web OS that uses [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) to let user set its root folder anywhere!
From then on user is free to navigate and edit files, check photos or even browse the web!

## File System Access API

Experimental technology that works in all latest browsers except Firefox and Internet Explorer. Due to the nature of technology please use Chromium browsers or latest versions of Safari for best user experience

## Known Bugs

File System Access API needs users permission to work. Sometimes when app is refreshed Chrome won't ask for users permission again; in those cases just refresh the app again and it should come to its senses.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
